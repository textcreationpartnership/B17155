            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN Answer to the Hertford Letter; IN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A Quaker and his Neighbour, Concerning the MURTHER of Mrs. Sarah Stout.</head>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quaker.</speaker>
               <p>THee art an early man to day, methinks Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to have been abroad, and are coming back already.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neighb.</speaker>
               <p>I must be so now; I have been to see my folks at work in the field; for he that will have business go forward, must be both at the begining and end of it himself, or else it will wont do; And the Weather of late hath been pretty catching, which makes me willing to improve my time as well as I can, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the antient Proverb, <hi>To make Hay whil the Sun shines.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Qua.</speaker>
               <p>Thou art in the right on't, and I commend thee for thy industry: Well wilt come in, and smoak a pipe of Tobacco?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neigh.</speaker>
               <p>I don't care if I do; for now <hi>I</hi> have set my folks to work, I am a little at seisure; besides I have a mind to talk with you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Qua.</speaker>
               <p>With all my heart, Neighbour: Well, what is it thou wouldst talk with me about?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neigh.</speaker>
               <p>Abut! Why, <hi>I</hi> wou'd ask you, What's the best news? for I know you must hear it, if there be any, your business calls you so much abroad.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Qua.</speaker>
               <p>Why truly Neighbour, as to news, I know none; for tho' I can't, as thee says, but here a great deal, yet I seldom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it; for, for there is scarce one in twenty, that is to be credited</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neigh.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, that's true enough: But what I intended was, What do you hear about the Tryal of the Gentleman for the Murther of Mrs. <hi>Sarah Stout?</hi> It makes a great nose in the world, I assure you: I suppose you have heard it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Qua.</speaker>
               <p>No, <hi>I</hi> didn't; for I was out of Town then, or else <hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>I</hi> shou'd. But <hi>I</hi> have read the Printed Account of it, which <hi>I</hi> suppose is truth, because it is attested by the Judge.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neigh.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, so it is, for I have read the Book, and heard the Tryal from the beginning to the end. Well, fince you have read it, what do you say to that Tryal?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Qua.</speaker>
               <p>Why, <hi>I</hi> say, the persons Indcted for that Murther, were every one acquitted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neigh.</speaker>
               <p>That's true enough every body knows: But do you think they were acquitted fairly, or not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Qua.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis none of my place to censure the proceedings of the King's Courts of Justice; <hi>I</hi> believe the King desires Justice may be impartially administred, and <hi>I</hi> believe to that end the King makes choice of the best Judges. But after all, to be plain with thee, I am of an Opinion <hi>Sarah Stout</hi> was Murther'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neigh.</speaker>
               <p>If she Murther'e herself, she was Murther'd; so that your words are equivocal: Do you think she was Murther'd by the Gentlemen that were Try'd for it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Qua.</speaker>
               <p>Wou'dst have me to condemn those whom the Law has acquitted? Or, is't not possible she may be Murther'd, and yet not Murther'd by them? And as to her Murthering herself, <hi>I</hi> belive nothing of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neigh.</speaker>
               <p>That she was found dead in the water, that's plain; &amp; if she did not throw herself in, she was thrown in by some bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy else: But there's no such thing appears, and therefore <hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve she Drowned herself.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Qua.</speaker>
               <p>What reason hath thee to think so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neigh.</speaker>
               <p>Reason enough: For first, That she was not Murder'd for Money, appears plainly, because there was six Pounds found in her Pocket when she was taken up out of the water; and therefore it was not don by Thieves or Robbers, for they wov'd have taken away her Money at last, if they had not stript her too. Nor did it appear upon the Tryal, that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> had any Bonds or Mortgages of hers in his hands, by which he might make any Advantage: Nor had he got her with Child, by which any shame might have been prevented. And therefore, sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e he cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d no interst in it, why shou'd it suppos'd he did at all? Nay, there had kindness past between'm that day, and in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity might have been more. We don't herr of any quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween'em, that might give him any distaste, or provoke him to such a barbarous villany: And to think that a Gentleman should Murther a young Woman that had a kindness for him, meerly for Murther's sake, apperrs to me a very unreasonable thing</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Qua.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou seem'st to imply, I think, that</hi> Sarah Stout <hi>was murder'd by</hi> S. C. <hi>and I have already told thee, that I have nothing to say either to him, or the others that were indicted for her Murder, for the Law has acquitted them, or otherwise I could easily answer all that thou hast saide I could tell thee, That be might have an interest in her death, tho' it did not appeer in Court, that some men are so tenacious in receiving an affront, that many have been killed for giveing it. Nay, the very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses that some persons have done, has been the occasion of their Death; and the refusing to do such kindnesses as have been desired of them, has procur'd the death of others: That there might be something desir'd of</hi> Sarah, <hi>that she was not willing to grant, is what might be, tho' she did not think it proper to make any one acquainted with it; and that such kindness being refus'd, might be a sufficient ground of revenge, to such persons as made no conscience of what they did, for none but such persons could be guilty of so barbarous a Crime. Now it appears by the Tryal, that one of the persons indicted, has pretended Love to her, which she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd; what if he had stomach'd that refusal of hers to that degree, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he was resolv'd to be reveng'd of her for it? Does not this appear ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal enough? And, does not the discourse of the Persons at the Inn, at the very time when either this murder was perpretrated, or very near it, seem to countenance this? Why else should one of them say,</hi> Her Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was done, <hi>and,</hi> that he would pass his word her Courting days were over? <hi>And, this to be spoken by pretended Strangers, that very Night she was murther'd, was enough to have made it suspicious to me: And to confute what thou h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st offerred, that there could be no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in it: it being plain that there might be (I don't say there was) the interest of serving a Friend, which is counted by some (tho in as bad a Cause as this) a piece of generosity.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neigh.</speaker>
               <p>I confess what you urge has more weight in it, than I at first imagin'd: But tho' I think this was sworn, yet it was afterwards confuted by several Witnesses; which I think ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Trial Printed at large.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Qua.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Had that been done, it would have given great satisfaction b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

There was two Witnesses possitive to the very Words, and against this, they have nothing to s y, but that they possitively deny it; and yet are forc'd to acknowledge, there was some discourse of</hi> Sarah Stout; <hi>but so far from what the Witnesses depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that it was not possible they should so mistake'em. And thee may'st likewise observe, That the Witnesses not only deposed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>The Tryal lasted many hours, and many Witnesses were examined, and both Judge and Jury were so fatieg'd with the rediousness thereof, that it was impossible to think of every thing. But it did appear plainly, tho' her Body had no violence offer'd to et; that it sunk in the water as low as the Stakes would give it leave; that Mr. <hi>C—r</hi> went immediately out of the house to the <hi>Glove</hi> and <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and from thence to his own lodgings; from whence he went out no more that night: And, by comparing all what the Witnesses said, as to point of time, it was impossible he should do it; and what was impossible to be done, we may be sure was not done: So that I think the Jury brought in a very honest Verdict, especially as to him. As to the other Gentlemen, they appear all to be of fair reputations, and I could heartily wish, no such words had been spoken; and then I think, that they neither could not have been under the least suspition of guilt, tho' I am still of the mind they are all innocent.</hi>
